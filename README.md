# Program-structure: EJS-Chessboard
program that creates a string that represents an n×n grid

# About The Project

This is an exercise in the book Eloquent Javascript. 
program that creates a string that represents an n×n grid
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

# Built with:

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

for and while loops, nested loops, array, array method, string methods

# What I learned/Challenges:

I learnt to debug my code by placing console.log statements several points to see what output was generated.

A line of code in the wrong place can totally distabilise the whole project.

The need to think outside the box to develop own solution

Sometimes you need to take a break and get back to work with a fresh head

Didn't use the new line character for my solution (\n) 

# Further Challenge:

use only one loop to solve this with the new line character
